# = Class: pe_upgrade::params
#
# This class provides lookup of values for the upgrade process
#
# == Variable Use
#
# Each variable respects a global variable so that you can use this module
# from the console. If a global variable is not defined then the class falls
# back to a default value.
#
# === [*version*]
#
# The version of PE to install
#
# * global variable: pe_upgrade_version
# * default value: the PE version on the master
#
# === [*download_dir*]
#
# * global variable: pe_upgrade_download_dir
# * default value: https://pm.puppetlabs.com/puppet-enterprise/${version}
#
# === [*checksum*]
#
# The md5 checksum used to verify the installer download
#
# * global variable: pe_upgrade_checksum
# * default value: undef (no verification)
#
# === [*answersfile*]
#
# The node answersfile
#
# * global variable: pe_upgrade_answersfile
# * default value: pe_upgrade/answers/default-agent.txt.erb
#
# === [*mode*]
#
# Select whether to upgrade PE versions or upgrade Puppet open source to PE.
#
# * global variable: pe_upgrade_mode
# * default value: upgrade
#
# === [*migrate_certs*]
#
# If **mode** is set to install, this will optionally migrate the open source
# SSL directory to the PE installation.
#
# * global variable: pe_upgrade_migrate_certs
# * default value: false
#
# === [*server*]
#
# The server variable to use when templating the answersfile.
#
# * global variable: pe_upgrade_server
# * default value: $::server
#
# === [*certname*]
#
# The certname variable to use when templating the answersfile.
#
# * global variable: pe_upgrade_certname
# * default value: $::clientcert
#
# === [*timeout*]
#
# The timeout in seconds for the download of the Puppet Enterprise installer.
#
# * global variable: pe_upgrade_timeout
# * default value: 3600 seconds

# === [*allow_downgrade*]

# the downgrade validation will be bypassed.
#
# * global variable: pe_upgrade_allow_downgrade
# * default value: false
#
# === [*upgrade_master*]
#
# By default, pe_upgrade will not try to upgrade Puppet masters, since they're
# somewhat sensitive. Enabling this # will bypass those checks. Use with caution.
#
# * global variable: pe_upgrade_upgrade_master
# * default value: false
#
# === [*verbose*]
#
# Generate warnings and notifications. If this is enabled then reports for
# nodes with this class might always report as changed.
